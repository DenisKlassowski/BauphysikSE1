= Projekt Bauphysik Test Cases: <optional: use-case name>

//This is a informal template for represeting test cases

== Test Case <ID> - <Test Case Name>:

//The Test Case ID should be unique. In addition, the name of each Test Case should reflect the intent of the test case, ideally expressed as a Boolean condition.

=== Description
//Describe the logical condition that the Test Case evaluates. 
//Include the expected result.

=== Pre-conditions
//List conditions that must be true before this Test Case can start.

=== Post-conditions
//List conditions that should be true when this Test Case ends.

=== Data required
//Identify the type of data required for this Test Case.


=== Checklist

==== General

- does the Test Case identify the requirement it evaluates?  This linking might be informal through a naming convention or formalized through a requirements traceability matrix.
- does the Test Case reference the preconditions and postconditions that apply to it?

==== Name

- is the Test Case name unique?
- does the name express a test condition or an expected result?
- is it unambiguous to a stakeholder?

==== Brief Description

- is the logical test condition clearly identified in the description?
- does the description clearly state the expected result?
- is the expected result stated as a concrete outcome?
- can a casual reader distinguish this Test Case from a similar one?

==== Test Data Needs

- does the Test Case note the kinds of test data required to implement a detailed Test Script?
- are the test data type, uniqueness, and quality sufficiently explained?
